<P><span style="color:white">Our Message:</span>Soccer is becoming an increasingly popular sport to play in America, especially in the South. Georgia along with Texas, North Carolina, and Florida are the states where soccer is the most popular and also the most competitive. All the top professionals and coaches across the world have agreed that the full development of a player MUST start at a young age. That is our goal here, to make Atlanta Youth Soccer a program that kids can start in at an early enough age to where their full potential can be reached. Now, there are a lot of city kids that love and want to play soccer, but cannot do so either because of the intense competition or financial reasons. We want to give kids an opportunity to better themselves not only as soccer players, but as people too. All while keeping the price at a level even less wealthy families will be able to afford. We are all about giving an affordable chance to any kid who wants the opportunity to develop their game and to be able to compete at the next level.  </P>
